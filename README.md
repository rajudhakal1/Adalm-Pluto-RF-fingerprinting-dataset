The data collection process involves 11 different ADALM-PLUTO Software-Defined Radios (SDRs) programmed and controlled via MATLAB. One ADALM-PLUTO functions as the receiver (RX), capturing the in-phase (I) and quadrature (Q) signal components transmitted by the remaining 10 TX SDRs. The TX transmits real-time Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) signals. All data collection was conducted in an indoor office room where TX and RX PLUTO devices were positioned in fixed locations. The transmitting and receiving devices were configured with a 128-point FFT, a 32-point cyclic prefix, 72 active subcarriers, 30 kHz subcarrier spacing, and a channel bandwidth of 1 MHz. After each nine subcarriers, a pilot signal was inserted to correct the phase at the receiving end. Each frame transmitted consisted of a synchronization signal generated using a Zadoff--Chu sequence, followed by a reference symbol for channel estimation. The header was encoded with BPSK at a 1/2 rate for robustness, followed by 30 QPSK-modulated data symbols encoded with convolutional coding at a 1/2 rate. There were null carriers at the DC and band edges to confine the spectral emissions. A carrier frequency of 1 GHz was used to mimic IoT nodes. The transmitter and receiver PLUTOs was set to 60 dB and 71 dB, respectively. Frames were repeated and buffered to meet the PLUTO hardware's minimum waveform size requirement. The system performs synchronization, FFT demodulation, frequency offset correction, and signal decoding at the receiving end. The decoded and known transmitted header bits were compared using MATLABâ€™s comm.ErrorRate function. Overall Bit Error Rate (BER) was zero for each transmission for the collected data. From each TX device, 19,920 frames were collected, each consisting of 72 header I/Q samples and 1728 payload I/Q samples. Fingerprints were extracted exclusively from the header as it is well-suited for capturing hardware-specific imperfections.
